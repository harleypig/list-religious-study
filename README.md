## Scripture Study Resources
A list of sites related to religious and spiritual study and discussion.

This is based from my own personal list, and is of a decidely LDS slanted
nature. I originally intended to accept any religious or spiritually based
resource, but as I was compiling this list from various sources I found that
I was discarding sites that I felt were not useful from a LDS point of view,
so this list will continue to have an LDS focus.

Generally speaking, I will not accept submissions or pull requests containing
sites that are 'anti' in behaviour. Some obvious exceptions are the The
Skeptic's annotated series, which I find an equal opportunity 'anti' site and
a good source of topics to study. If you have any question about the
appropriateness of a site, please open a ticket and include the site there.
